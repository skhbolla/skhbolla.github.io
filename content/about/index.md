<!-- <img src="/images/me.png" alt="Professional Portrait" width="200" style="margin-bottom: 30px"/> -->

Iâ€™m a backend and cloud enthusiast who loves turning ideas into working systems. With over 2 years of experience as a Software Engineer, Iâ€™ve worked on building application-level automation and deploying solutions on cloud infrastructure.

Most of my work revolves around **Python** and **AWS**, but Iâ€™m also expanding my skills with **REST APIs, Docker, and cloud-native design**. What excites me most is building systems that are not only scalable and reliable, but also practical and innovative â€” and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and adopt modern engineering practices along the way.


I enjoy exploring:
- **Cloud-native architectures** and scalable systems  
- **Advanced Python** techniques for automation & backend development  
- **AI integrations** that make software smarter and more intuitive
